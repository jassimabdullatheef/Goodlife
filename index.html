          <p>I’m really excited to be giving away this FREE GoodLife Bottle to our Tyent Alkaline Water community.</p>
          <p>Like I said in the video above “No one who drinks alkaline water should be left with only UNSAFE CHOICES for
          carrying their alkaline water.” And, I want to make sure that when you are traveling and trying to drink healthy
          alkaline water that you keep its benefits, no matter what. </p>
          <p>So far we have shipped more than 2323 of these GoodLife Bottles in the last few days, and we are QUICKLY running out, so grab yours now while supplies last. </p>
          <p>P.S. Do me a favor if you can and share this page with your friends on Facebook, or email it to your  friends (just wait until after you grab yours, in case we run out).</p>
          <p>Remember, we’re all in this together.</p>
